## Background and Project Description

Companions Journeying Together runs a program called Aunt Mary's Storybook where they record incarcerated parents reading books to their children, and we send the book and recording to the child's caregiver to give to the child on the outside. They have an online application that serves both as a database and as an inventory and mailing tool for our program. The application is coded in PHP on the [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com) framework and uses APIs from [EasyPost](https://www.easypost.com) and [SmartyStreets](https://smartystreets.com). The system is mostly useable, but there are several edits and additions that they wish to make. Additionally, they would like to move the backend to AWS and if there is time, the project team will assist with that.
